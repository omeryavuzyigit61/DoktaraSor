## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omeryavuzyigit61/DoktaraSor/master/homess.png)

I created this mobile application so that doctors can respond by telling users their problems.

Here's why:

* To ensure that the problems of the users can be solved through the application by preventing them from wasting time by going to the hospital. If it is not possible, ensure that the doctor can communicate what he has to do
* To ensure that users can convey their problems without going into a complex structure.


## Built With

I wrote this project in Kotlin/Android

## Usage

Clone and use this project on Android Studio
